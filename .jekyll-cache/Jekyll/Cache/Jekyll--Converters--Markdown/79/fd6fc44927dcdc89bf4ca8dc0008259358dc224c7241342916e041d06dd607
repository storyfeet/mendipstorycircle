I"š<p>Regular monthly meeting of the Circle at Chewton Mendip Village Hall BA3 4LL.</p>

<p>As promised, this meeting of the circle was a â€œcrackerâ€ with real Christmas crackers and chocolate money! Janet got us off to a great start with the story of Van Amsterdam and the origin of the Bakers Dozen. Jem then came on with a story about Father Christmasâ€™s donkey.</p>

<p>Hazel followed with not one, but three of her self penned verses:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A Mouse at Christmas</li>
  <li>A poignant verse about a Soldier</li>
  <li>The Christmas Fairyâ€™s Lament.</li>
</ol>

<p>Martin did his â€œvery short storyâ€, I think a total of nine words long. Mike did the first of several jokes. Terence told the English traditional â€œfairy storyâ€ The Rose Tree. Sharon did a physically demanding story about a King who wanted a champion grasshopper. Colin told a version of â€œThe Cracked Potâ€ Matt a Chinese set story about redistributive justice and a Shed! Jem did another story about a â€œSilvery Giftâ€ from that prolific storyteller Duncan Williamson. And finally George finished the evening off by reciting a poem by Robert Service â€œThe Cremation of Sam McGeeâ€.</p>
