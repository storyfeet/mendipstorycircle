Drift writes and performs his own stories.....and it's nice of him to take the blame. 
Drift is teller of modern stories relating the trials and tribulations of one short, bald man as he 
tries to navigate the pitfalls of daily life. Do not expect any moral lessons, except, perhaps
to be glad you're not Drift.
Drift Snowbarger, short man, tall stories.
Drift performs regularly around the area and has performed at Buddha Field Festival, 
All in the Mind Festival, Bath Comedy Festival, Bath Fringe, Exeter Fringe,
Frome Festival, Hotwells Festival and has even performed in Canada.
