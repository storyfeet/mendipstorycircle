Mendip Storytelling Circle bring the ancient art of storytelling alive. The Circle is run by and for people who love the telling of 'stories', be they traditional, contemporary or whatever! Stories, poems or ballads all come alive right in front of you! 

Mendip Storytelling Circle meet on the 2nd Wednesday of the month at Ston Easton Village Hall, Green Street, Ston Easton, BA3 4DA

Doors open at 7:30pm, for 7.45pm start. Stories finish at 9.30pm.

We would love you to come along and enjoy the magic of 'story'.

Mendip Storytelling Circle is a team of 4 storytellers - Colin, Martin, Janet and Drift - each with their individual style and way of storytelling. Other pieces are performed by the audience and guests. 

You are welcome to come along and share your story or poem or song - or just sit back and listen, for what is story without listeners? If you do wish to perform, you may book a slot on the night with the evenings host. There are two points to bear in mind - your piece should be no longer than 10 minutes and should not be read. Part of the magic of story is when it is told and woven in front of you, from memory.

We would love to see (and hear!) from you at our next meeting!

We ask people to make a contribution of Â£5 (where possible) to help cover with hall hire, heating and the interval tea, coffee and biscuits.
