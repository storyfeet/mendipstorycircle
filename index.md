Mendip Storytelling Circle is an open club run by four people: Colin, Martin, Janet and Terence (hereafter referred to as the Quartet). We have been holding monthly meetings September to June on Thursday evenings since 2013.

Our aim is to share the joy of orally telling stories from memory in the form of narratives, poems and ballads. Although we would also welcome other forms of communication such as Mime, Puppetry and Sign language.

We normally meet on the 2nd Wednesday of the month

Doors open 7:30pm, start time 7.45pm, finish 9.30pm.

Currently we meet at Ston Easton Village Hall, Green Street, Ston Easton, BA3 4DA

One of our Quartet always plays "host" or "master of ceremony's" and another tells the first story, but after that stories can come from anyone.  

If you want to tell a story, speak to the host at the beginning of the meeting.  We recommend that stories last no longer than about 10 minutes unless specially arranged with one of the Quartet before the evening.

Before stories begin at 8.00 pm and during the intermission tea and coffee and biscuits are made available by our "catering gang" of Carol and another Janet.

We don't charge for admission to our evening Circle, nor for the refreshments. However we do invite anyone who attends and enjoys the evening to drop a contribution "in the hat" to help with the cost of hall hire, heating and advertising.
