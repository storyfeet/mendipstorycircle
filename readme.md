Editing Mendip Story Circle Website
===============================

Using Github in General
-------------

The primary way to edit this site is to "fork" it, "commit" changes on the fork and then make a "Pull Request" to put the changes back here.

* fork : Copy the entire site into your own github account
* commit : Make a change and record the change as a kind of event
    You will need to add a note saying what you have done
* Pull Request : Request the changes in your fork be applied to the original (storyfeet/mendipstorycircle)

If you have already made a fork, before making changes, it's worth trying to 'fetch' changes made on the original.  This should be 1 or two clicks, to check if your fork is up to date.
