You are a born storyteller - you may not know it yet, but you are! We tell each other stories all the time - what happened on the way to work; what happened on your holiday. It is that easy!  Come along and give it a go!

Mendip Storytelling Circle is a welcoming and supportive place for all storytellers, whether complete 'newbies' or veterans. If you have a story or poem or even a song to share we would love to hear it.

Be warned - storytelling is addictive!

We have just 3 rules that we ask you to bear in mind -

1. No Reading.    Please tell your story from memory or ad lib. 
2. 10 Minutes limit. Please keep your story to under 10 minutes - a 2 minute story can still be a great one!
3. Listen. Please respect and be kind to the tellers who have spent time preparing their stories. Show your appreciation at the end too, it helps people to have another go.
